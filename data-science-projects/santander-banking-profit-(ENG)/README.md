# Santander Transaction Prediction — End-to-End ML Pipeline

This project implements a full **Data Science and Machine Learning workflow** applied to the **prediction of a bank transaction** based on **200 anonymous features**.  
The goal is to optimize a **business KPI**, being *total business profit*, defined as:

$\text{Profit} = \text{30€} \times \text{TP} - \text{5€} \times \text{FP}$

---

## 🚀 Key Results

- **Best model:** Large Neural Network (input → 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 → output)
- **Test-set profit (40k samples):** > €60,000  
- **Per-customer benefit:** +€1.50  
- **Estimated real-world value:** > €90,000,000 per year

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This project is:

- **Not affiliated** with Banco Santander or any of its subsidiaries.  
- **Not intended for commercial deployment**.  
- Built **exclusively for educational and portfolio purposes**.  
- Based on a **public Kaggle dataset** with anonymized features.  
- Not representative of real Santander operations, models, or internal data.  

Any reference to *monetary value*, *profit*, or *impact estimates* is **hypothetical**, serving only to demonstrate how a Data Scientist evaluates **business KPIs** within a modeling exercise.

## 🧩 Final Notes

This project is **fully reproducible** and aims to show:
- technical competence  
- modeling intuition  
- software design maturity  
- the ability to justify modeling decisions  

It is not intended to replicate any real Santander system, and all numbers are purely for **demonstrative, non-commercial** purposes
