🧠 Project Title – [Short Descriptive Name]
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, from dataset exploration to model training, evaluation, and deployment.
It is designed to be accessible for both technical and non-technical audiences, with interactive notebooks, visual slides, and a deployed demo.

📂 Repository Structure

notebook.ipynb → Full Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, training and evaluation

slides.pdf → Presentation slides (summary, visuals, and key insights for a broad audience)

dataset.csv → Dataset used for training/testing

model_test.xlsx → Comparison of trained models (metrics, strengths/weaknesses)

Deployment → Hosted on HuggingFace Spaces
 for public use

🚀 Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering and visualization

Multiple model training (decision trees, gradient boosting, etc.)

Model comparison with quantitative metrics (Accuracy, F1, etc.)

Deployed interactive demo on HuggingFace

📊 Evaluation

We used several metrics to evaluate model performance across classes:

Accuracy (per class + overall)

Macro F1-score (balanced view across categories)

Confusion Matrix

📑 A detailed comparison is available in model_test.xlsx.

🌍 Deployment

The best-performing model is deployed on HuggingFace Spaces:
