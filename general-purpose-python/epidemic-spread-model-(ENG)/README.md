### SIR Epidemic Simulation ###

A Python script that simulates the classic SIR epidemiological model, focusing only on infections and recoveries over time.

---

## Model Overview

The SIR model divides a population into 3 groups:

- S – Susceptible (can catch the infection)
- I – Infected (currently infected and contagious)
- R – Recovered (no longer contagious)

At each step, individuals move from S to I to R

The user selects some starter parameters, and then an iterated graph will be shown representing the evolution of the different groups over time.
